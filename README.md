# PotionHUD Fabric
This addon ports over the potion HUD from 1.9 Vanilla. [Here's a preview of it working in BTW](https://imgur.com/f7NCovU)

[Download](https://github.com/BTW-Community/PotionHUD-Fabric/releases/latest)

If you would like to use the 1.14 potion icons, you can also download the texture pack here:
[1.14 Potion HUD Textures](https://github.com/BTW-Community/1.9-Potion-HUD/releases/tag/textures)

Additionally, this mod prevents the inventory GUI from shifting when a potion effect is applied.
